# hello-world

Hi, Humans!

This is my first day of practicing the app github.
2017.10.29 Sunday night. Boston Career Forum is coming up soon.
I hope the art of programming and coding would lead me to the better future.
I believe in you and in myself.

Thank you!

2nd editing. There are many things that I still need to learn and know eventually.
